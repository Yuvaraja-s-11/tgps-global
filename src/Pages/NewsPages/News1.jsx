             While global attention has long been on Ethereum’s innovation, Frequency Chain X was built with a distinct philosophy — to solve persistent challenges like high gas fees, network bottlenecks, and environmental trade-offs. This is achieved through its proprietary S2PoS (Solid Split Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism, which delivers high transaction throughput, ultra-low energy consumption, and robust decentralization without compromising performance.
