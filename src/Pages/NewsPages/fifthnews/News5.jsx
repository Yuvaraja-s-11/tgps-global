             In a public post, Ponsana highlighted how children using grocery and instant-delivery apps for everyday needs are inadvertently exposed to adult and age-inappropriate product listings, due to the absence of effective content filters or age-based access controls. Speaking from personal experience as a parent, she described the issue as a growing challenge in today’s app-driven households.

              Her comments quickly gained traction across social media and technology circles, prompting a public response from Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal, whose company operates Blinkit. Acknowledging the concern, Goyal stated that the feedback was valid and confirmed that efforts are underway to address child-safety features on such platforms .

              The exchange has since evolved into a broader discussion on ethical technology design, parental safeguards, and platform accountability, particularly as quick-commerce apps become increasingly integrated into family life.
